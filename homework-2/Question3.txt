I feel like the grid and Flexbox layouts are super versitile.
In the Fordham Webpage I was able to make the basic structure of the body using a grid system, and then manage the content within the
grid by turning the covered sections into flex boxes. It took me a while to realize how I can use a grid inside of a flexbox, or vice-versa
-> all inside another box of some sort! 

I think the flexbox is a bit more handy, and my brain has an easier time imagining all the elemnts inside the box and how they sit next to each other. 
It also took me a while to get comfortable with the CSS tools for flexbox, but once you understand them you are able to manipluate boxes significantly. 
I also see how developers build frameworks that speed up their projects. For example, if you use a common flexbox or grid setup in most of your designs, 
you might as well save that code so it can later be applied to other projects. This is the idea behind bootstrap I think. 

One fall back for flexboxes is that it's hard to get the box-items to line up abnormally, or not in a straight line. For example, in the Fordham Webpage, 
the image is technically a flex-box-item, but it had to be margined and off-set vertically to align it evenly with the text. I'm sure there are easier
ways to manage this, but I haven't figured it out yet.

I feel like my understanding of flexboxes is really displayed in the Fordham Webpage Footer. The whole footer is a flexbox aligned horizontally, but the
contents are also flexboxes, aligning the content vertically (Flex inside of flex).
