1. HTML is a markup language that describes the structure of pages. It uses a simple syntax consisting
        of tags and attributes that allows us to create a block structure of the page content. 

2. CSS is a styling language that follows cascading logic to apply styles to HTML elements. It basically provides color,
    shape control, fonts, and many other options for customization. 

3. The header is separated from the body of the page and immediatly indicates where you are (Fordham.edu), and it has main links 
    that easily direct you to other parts of the website. The background sits behind two content blocks. The first is the main attraction,
    an article about the top 5 things she learned about retail. This is clearly indicated by the picture, and the large style font for the 
    title of the article. It also provides a link, encouraging the user to click further in. THe news content block is smaller, with smaller photos -- 
    ultimately drawing less attention. 

    Desgin wise, the background goes all the way up to the header, and the whole page has a boarder around the side and bottom. 
    The very top of the next content block is showing, inviting the user to scroll down. This is a completely separate block, with a new header (Maybe h2?).
    This section also has links that direct the user to the websites/pages for other campus'.

    The calendar section is cool because it allows the user to scroll sideways, cronologically, to see upcoming events. This is 
    intuitive and is kept to a relativley small block. 

    The footer has more niche links, and a clear logo/indication that it's Fordham.edu. It also has links to social media like 
    facebook, instagram, twitter, etc...

4. An HTML element is content that sits between two tags. This allows it to be identified and selected in CSS. 
    A tag is an actual syntax tool that indicates the type of content that rests between it's opening and closing tag. 
    For example, <p> These tags indicate that this sentence is a paragraph element. </p>  
    An Attribute is an additional piece of information that is put inside a tag to give the tag special instructions. 
    You can use attributes to make a section identifiable so it can later be selected in css, or you can add an attribute that points 
    to another link or folder. This allows you to give special instruction to a specific element. 

5.  The first is a selector, which indicates what html element you wish to edit. The second is declarations, which are the 
    specific instructions of the CSS rule. 

6. My first thought was to google the definition of cascade, which helps visualize it. CSS cascades in that it follows the order of CSS 
    rules in the sylesheet. If one rule is placed below another, both for the same element, the latter rule will be enacted. This helps us 
    also understand why specificity is important. While the rules follow the order they are written in the style sheet, more specific selectors
    will override the order flow and allow the specific element to be edited while not effect the rest of the style around it. When writing in HTML, it's 
    important to think about this specificity to make CSS styling easier. For example, knowing that ID is more specific than Class, and when to apply them
    ppropriately.

7. Steps: Back to project-1 -> into images -> select pinecone.jpg
    ../images/pinecone.jpg
    HTML File:
    <img src="../images/pinecone.jpg>

8. I think the default behavior is to add the data to the URL. The correct way to handle it is to include an action=" " attrubute to the <form> tag,
    indicating where the data should be sent.
